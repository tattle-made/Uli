# 👋 Say Hi

The very first thing you should do is letting us know that you are interested in contributing by the following means :

If you are unsure about how to contribute to Kosh, simply join our slack and introduce yourself and mention what interests you about Uli. We'll reach out and assist you further.

If there's a particular improvement you want to suggest, or a bug in kosh you want to fix, simply create a Github Issue regarding it and we'll reach out to assist you further.

If you are interested in knowing what we are working on right now, head over to the [project page](https://github.com/tattle-made/OGBV/projects?type=beta). If any issue there interests you, comment on it for any clarification.

# 🔨 Do your thing
You should be able to run Uli on your own machine (guide)[README.md] and make changes.


## Pair programming

We offer pair programming sessions with community members to familiarize them with the product and the code base. This will give you an opportunity to clarify any doubts regarding the codebase and the features that interest you.

Once you have a local instance of Kosh running, you can make the changes you want to the code. Test the features and add appropriate documentation for it if needed.

# 📞 Tell us

All code changes happen via pull request. We use [Github Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/). The easiest way to let us know if you want to combine your changes into the core code is to make a Pull Request (PR)

In your PR, please mention the following :

- What does this PR do?
- How do we test this PR?

We don't strictly follow test driven development (TDD) but any contributions that include tests are greatly appreciated.

# 🎉 Celebrate

We typically review a PR within 2-3 days. We might offer you some feedback to your PR and merge it! If you reached till this stage, Congratulations and join us afterwards for virtual coffee/tea on slack 🙂
