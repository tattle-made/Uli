# Build from Source

Requirements :

- npm : v8.3.1^
- nodejs : 16.14.0^

When you run `docker-compose up`, ensure to have a `development.env` file with the following variables in the `api-server` directory.

```
NODE_ENV=development
AWS_BUCKET_NAME=XXXXXXXXXXX
SERVICE_AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=XXXXXXXXXX
SERVICE_AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=XXXXXXX
DB_HOST: XXXXXXXXXXX
DB_USERNAME: XXXXXXXXXXX
DB_PASSWORD: XXXXXXXXXXX
```



## For Development

```
git clone https://github.com/tattle-made/Uli.git
cd Uli/browser-extension/
cd plugin && npm install
cd ..
cd api-server && npm install
cd ..
docker-compose up
```

If you get `ERROR: Unknown database 'uli_dev'`
, the database was not successfully created and database migration failed. Manually create the `uli_dev` database by logging into `http://localhost:8080/` using the username and password from `Uli/browser-extension/api-server/db/config/config.js` and execute the following

```
docker compose down -v
docker compose up
```
You should now see database migration in the logs. The `api-server` will be running now.

For local plugin development, add the following two entries to the `connect-src` in the manifest's `content_security_policy`:
```
http://localhost:3000 ws://localhost
```

To run the plugin development server, run `cd plugin` and then the following :

1. For Chrome : `npm run dev:chrome`
2. For Firefox : `npm run dev:firefox`

If all services run correctly, you should be able to load the plugin from `plugin/dist` folder into Chrome/Brave/Firefox.

#### For Windows only

If you are developing on Windows and run into errors where certain files are not being copied, go to `plugin/package-json` and in the commands `npm run dev:chrome` and `npm run dev:firefox`, replace the command `cp` with `copy` and the front slashes in all the file paths to double back slashes. Secondly, running the commands mentioned in the table above will create a `-p` and a `dist` folder everytime which you will need to delete in order to generate a new distribution to reflect major changes.

## Installing unreleased extension

To learn how to install unreleased extension in your browser follow the instructions [here](https://webkul.com/blog/how-to-install-the-unpacked-extension-in-chrome/)

Look into individual README within the `api-server` and `plugin` folder for more info.

## Cleaning changes

In order to remove the dist folder to start with a new distribution, run the following command:

```
cd plugin && npm run dev:clean
```

## For Production

For Chrome/Brave:

```
cd plugin && npm run build
```

For Firefox:

```
cd plugin && npm run build:firefox
```

This will bundle all files related to the plugin into `/dist`, this can now be loaded on a browser or uploaded to the chrome store.
