# Research

The Uli team is cross-disciplinary. This is the list of publications based on work done by the authors with Uli. They are listed in rough chrological order and are not categorized by field or discipline. At the end of the page is an explicit section on Uli as an exploration of alternative imaginations of AI.

## Responsible/ Trustworthy/ Feminist AI

The project started as an exploration of building AI aligned with (feminist principles)[https://uli.tattle.co.in/blog/approach/]. There are many terms- such as responsible, ethical, trustworthy, participatory, feminist- to describe better or alternative visions of AI. Uli speaks to these themes, and also complicates them. A number of publications (listed above) are on the process and the reflection from trying to build Uli informed by these visions. More are forthcoming. The following presentation summarizes the process and reflection on specifically feminist principles in context of our work:
