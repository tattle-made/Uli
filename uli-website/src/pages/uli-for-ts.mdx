## Uli for Trust and Safety Teams

Uli relies on a number of resources such as :
1. A list of slurs in Indian languages, crowdsourced from activists and researchers
2. A dataset of abuse annotated by people at the receiving end of abuse
3. Translations of community guidelines
4. A machine learning model to detect abuse

Many of these resources are open but some are not. If you are working in South Asia or with South Asian diasporic communities and are interested in any of the backend resources for ensuring safety of your community online, please reach send an email to tarunima@tattle.co.in.
